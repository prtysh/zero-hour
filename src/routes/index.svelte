  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <h1>ZERO HOUR</h1>
  <p>
    Zero Hour E-Residency began as a response to the March 2020 lockdown
    procedures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suddenly creative
    spaces around the world were shut down and people were confined to their
    houses. Instead of focusing on the negatives, the team at We Belong Here
    decided to use this time to start a global conversation, an online residency
    which could not be possible conventionally. 5 visual and 6 performance
    artists from all across the world, came together to foster a sense of
    community and cross-arts collaboration. Over 4 weeks the artists were paired
    up and worked together to create a body of work reflecting upon the theme of
    Zero Hour. In this present climate, our future is fluid and time is
    relative. Zero Hour outlines the idea of how we begin again. As artists and
    as a collective whole, it lies in our hands to rewrite the shape of our
    future, making sure we create a new precedent that we can all be proud of.
    This E-residency has strived to create a space wherein you can find answers
    to these questions and be the architects of this new future.&nbsp;

  <h1>About We Belong Here</h1>
  <p>
    We Belong Here is a pioneering movement led by the creative community for
    the community. Co-founded by Natasha Joseph, Lucy Teoh &amp; Francesca Rodi,
    it is about experimenting with the crucial themes of today, exposing society
    to expression and collective sharing and always celebrating creativity and
    diversity. We Belong Here, based in Leeds, England, creates opportunities
    for these ideas to be catalysed by providing events that engage every kind
    of creative and give them a platform to exhibit, perform and express. We
    believe our community provides the building blocks of change. By supporting
    and nurturing them we create new generations of artists and artistry. We
    Belong Here stands by expression across art forms, be it artist, poets,
    dramatists, musicians or dancers, across age groups and across communities,
    building contemporary spaces where they may all exist in unison.
